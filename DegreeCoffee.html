<center><h2><b>There are multiple speculations as to why its called "degree" coffee:</b></h2></center>
<ul>
  <li><h3>It has a smell which creates a mood to consume it immediately.   
Its speciality is the use of cows' milk without any adulterants.   
Why it is called as Degree Coffee?   
In the olden days, milk that was certified as pure with a lactometer was called ‚Äúdegree milk‚Äù, and coffee that was prepared with this milk became popular as ‚Äúdegree coffee‚Äù.</h3></li>
<li><h3>The most plausible explanation is that it's not "degree" coffee. It's Chicory which came to be pronounced as tikeri and eventually became degree. Chicory helps extract more flavour from the coffee beans.</h3></li>
<li><h3>The first decoction is sometimes called the first degree, thus leading to the name degree coffee</h3></li>
<li><h3>Milk certified as pure with was called degree milk owing to a mistaken association with the thermometer. It is claimed that coffee prepared with degree milk became known as degree coffee.</h3></li>

<li><h3>It is actually "Decree Coffee" and not "Degree Coffee"! The story goes that, in the 19th century, a British Collector of Thanjavur District liked the coffee served by a local cook in Kumbakonam and he decreed that coffee served to him on all his travels should be like that!</h3></li>
